I have used Html Form and JavaScript to create a website where I can encrypt or decrypt a given plain text or cypher text with its respective key. 
Monoalphabetic Cipher is a cipher where the letters of the plain text are mapped to ciphertext letters based on a single alphabetic key. It is a one to one mapping.
